DUD-E
=====

The tarball contains all the data needed to run a docking
campaign on a single target from the DUD-E benchmark.
I have picked the smallest example, the INHA receptor,
with just 44 active ligands and some 2300 decoys. 
When docking the ligands should bind reasonably well,
whereas the decoys should not bind.
I am providing this material just in case someone wants to
play with this and see how well Autodock4 does on this
example.
